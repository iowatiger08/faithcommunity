    <mat-card-content>
      The Faith Community Church mission is to provide a truly welcoming, open
      and affirming ministry to all people seeking divine wisdom, no matter
      where one is on lifeâ€™s journey We are committed to theology that affirms
      the gospel teachings and wisdom that affirms differences (rather than
      rejecting them) in how people come to our higher power and how people
      believe in the Creator and sustainer of all life. This church community
      values equity, access, fairness and positive ideals - leaving judgment to
      that Creator. Thus, we serve the community in capacities that enrich lives
      and advocate for causes in the way the Spirit teaches us in the Gospels
      and the many great wisdoms around the world who share in the universal
      justice and truth.
